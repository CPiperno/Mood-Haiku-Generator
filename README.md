# Mood-Haiku-Generator

For the Literature in the Age of Artificial Intelligence course's final project, myself and Giselle Valdez, were inspired by the conception of poetic and combinational generators, and chose to create and conceive a haiku generator based on Kuhlmann’s “Love-Kiss XLI”.

In addition to the haiku generator, we aim to make the creative expression even more specific by having each poem signify a mood. Referencing our reading in Polti’s Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations, we plan to delineate 36 “emotions” or “moods” that each poem will mirror. When an individual decides to make a poem, they can first choose the mood that they hope to express and the generator will create a poem from their chosen emotion. The 36 emotions will be derived from each of the dramatic situations in Polti’s work. Therefore, through both the haiku format and the emphasis on emotional expression, we aspire to create an online platform which promotes creativity, permutation of language, and encoded poetry.

During a time as turbulent as the one we are living in, we aspire that our project can provide a creative outlet for individuals to create generative content based on their moods and current emotions. Each haiku can also provide solace during an uncertain time.
